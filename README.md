## What is BOINC?
[BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) is an open-source volunteer oriented computing grid that combines the processing power of all individual users for the purposes of scientific research.

Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is an open-source middleware system which supports volunteer and grid computing. Originally developed to support the SETI@home project, it became generalized as a platform for other distributed applications in areas as diverse as mathematics, linguistics, medicine, molecular biology, climatology, environmental science, and astrophysics, among others. BOINC aims to enable researchers to tap into the enormous processing resources of multiple personal computers around the world.

## Can I create an BOINC project?
Anyone can create a BOINC project, there's no centralised authority that you are required to consult before creating a BOINC project.

If you've got an idea for a distributed computing project, head on over to the [BOINC project brainstorming thread on STEEM](https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@cm-steem/brainstorming-new-boinc-projects-anyone-can-create-a-project-and-reward-their-users-with-gridcoin) to get an idea of possible BOINC projects.

## What's this talk of a whitelist?
The [BOINC project whitelist](https://www.gridcoin.us/Guides/whitelist.htm) is a voted upon list of projects rewarded within the [Gridcoin network](https://www.gridcoin.us). The Gridcoin network doesn't distribute rewards to all existing BOINC projects because some projects are inactive/dead or are insecure & pose a potential risk to our users.

If you have concerns regarding the whitelist or wish to have your project whitelisted then speak up in the <a href="https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/29841-discussion-boinc-whitelist-monitoring/">Gridcoin whitelist thread</a>.

Due to the nature of this BOINC project, there's nothing stopping you from ignoring the whitelist and distributing your crypto assets against non-whitelisted projects but you do so at your own risk (and potentially at the risk of your own crypto community).
