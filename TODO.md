# TODO

* Change /boincserver/ to /rain/
* Upon going live, implement SSL (Redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS too), Recaptcha and block malicious IP addresses.
* Fix private-messaging
* Partially implement message boards
* Email config/setup/verification.
* Improve password hashing mechanism from (md5+email salt) to becrypt.
 * Will changing password hashing mechanisms break compatability with the BOINC client?
* Improve the 'LOAD' phase in the PR ETL process!
 * Split the 1GB+ XML files!
* Change the index page to be less 'wall of text'. Perhaps large modals or images for Crunchers+Rain Makers. Link to more info, away from the front page.
* "Send Many" transaction generation improvement.
* Fix the Gridcoin NN Rain table script!
* Community outreach to get equivellant of 'send many' instructions for 30+ cryptocurrencies!
* Create a docker work unit using python - either a test/hello-world program, or an actual work unit that would compliment project rain (open to suggestions).
